# AI Shooter Combat

## Objective
The goal is to develop a video game in Unity to which the player combats against Artificial Intelligent agents who're capable of planning and adapting to any changes in a game environment. The AI agents plan to efficiently kill the player while cautious of their own vitality. This project is directly inspired by the 2006 video game F.E.A.R. created by Monolith studios and its marketable feature G.O.A.P. G.O.A.P. or Goal Oriented Action Planning, is a dynamic planning architecture created by Jeff Orkin that permits autonomous decision making for non-playable characters in games. By completing this project, we aim to learn the depths of how G.O.A.P. functions, thus allowing us to optimize it and integrate it with other systems. Most importantly, we aim to allow this projects systems to be transferable and scalable to other future gaming projects, even without the Unity Game Engine.
## How to Run the Game & How to Play

## What interested us to develop the Game


## What we learned
By developing the game, we learned about working as a team and independently on different systems, then integrating those systems together. Additionally, we learned about optimizing our systems to be scalable in order to develop addittional features to the game, and we learned better organization skills when working with each others' scripts.
Further, we committed ourselves to research in order to plan our development processes, including how to develop features around the G.O.A.P. architecture, and why G.O.A.P. was the optimal planning architecture for our game. 
## An In-Depth Look of the Game's Code Structure

### Why choose G.O.A.P.?
There are different AI planning systems in the Gaming industry, and the most popular are rule-based AI, finite state machines, behavior trees, and G.O.A.P. Rule-based AI defines how non-playable characters (NPCs) should react in various situations based on a set of predetermined rules and conditions. For example, if an AI combatant spots the player, the condition, then the AI combatant attacks the player, and an additional ruling is if the AI combatant is given orders that the player is hostile. Finite state machines (FSM) work similarly, in which NPC behavior is deconstructed into distinct states that share transitions with each other. A state represents a specific behavior or action and the transitions are the responses to triggers or fullfilled conditions. Analyzing the prior example in terms of a FSM,

## Additional Features to Apply in the Future

Games created on the Unity Engine

Goals:
1.Octopath traveler inspired Camera Angle and Interactive world: 3D environment with 2D sprites.

2.Playable character that can shoot.

Based on Character's visibility, the rest of the screen will be blurry, except for what the character could see.

3.Simple UI.

4.An A.I. similar to F.E.A.R. that attacks the player.

5. Create Sprites

Extra Goals:

1. Add decorations; doll everything up.
2. Breakable objects; debris falling. 
3. Complex UI.

4. Mirrors.
